# Before we get started!
This is a port/parody of Maplock by SplashCard. We **HIGHLY** recommend you to use Remapper instead of JavaScript, it's much easier and will get support for longer. If you need any help then please contact one of us: (It's advised to contact TsarK, he knows JavaScript more than ScuffedItalian and Splashcard)

# EnvSetting
Env Settings is a function that can make editing objects easier.

if you set ```disabled``` to true then there is no need to write out the other values


```
envSettings(true)
```

if you set ```disabled``` to false then satisfying (inputing) all the params are necessary!

```
envSettings(true,69, 69, 69, 69, etc...)
```

# NoteFiler
!! THIS WILL BE WORKED ON SOON !!

# Rgb Calulctor
The rgb calculator can save you minutes, in Beatsaber, colors
can only be set in decimals which require to divide the rgb
value(s) by 255, this function does that for you!
**Example**:
```
note.color = [ezRGB(69), ezRGB(255), ezRGB(33)]
```
