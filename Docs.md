# install

to install run 
```powershell
npm install mljs
```

# EnvSetting
Env Settings is a function that can make editing objects easier.

if ```disabled``` is set to true then setting other
values will be pointless.

```powershell
envSettings(true, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

if you do want to set ```disabled``` to true then filling out the other parms are needed!
