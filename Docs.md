# EnvSetting
Env Settings is a function that can make editing objects easier.

if you set ```disabled``` to true then there is no need to write out the other values


```powershell
envSettings(true, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

if you set ```disabled``` to false then satisfying (inputing) all the params are necessary!
